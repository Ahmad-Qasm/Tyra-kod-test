# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### The task from TYRA

Resolve possible bugs in the code.

Style the view for a better UI. Preferably so that it melts with the logo of TYRA.

Make it a working shopping list to add items, remove items, set item as picked.

Feel free to enhance the code with components and better Typescript.

Feel free to come up with own ideas to make this a great shopping list and develop the view.

Good to know:
We use tailwind as CSS framework.
We use i18next for translations.
We use FontAwesome for icons.
We use sweetalert2 for more user friendly alerts, toasts and information popups.
We use mobx as an observer for data and state management.
